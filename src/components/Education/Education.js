              Education is necessary and very important. Just getting it is not
              a finale. This is the beginning or the continuation of the
              practical realization of oneself as an individual. Expansion of
              the outlook, intellectual development, sociability, oratory,
              communication with adequate people, the ability to find a way out
              of a difficult situation through negotiations.
